# Agent Installation

There are three steps necessary to configure this architecture in HyperAutomation
1. Setting up the integrations
2. Uploading and activating the agents (workflows)
3. Updating the [API Endpoints in the MCP server](../server/server.py#L66-L71)

### Server Setup

####  Generating the Deployment Package

From the root of the project, run the command  `python configure_agents.py`

This will generate unique IDs for the agents and a deployment archive called `deployment_package.zip`

```python

ðŸ“¦ Creating zip archive: 'deployment_package.zip'...
ðŸŽ‰ Deployment package 'deployment_package.zip' is ready!
ðŸ§¹ Cleaning up the 'deployment' directory...

### Client Setup

###
**Agent Endpoints:**
- Update all webhook URLs in `AGENT_ENDPOINTS` dictionary in [server.py](./server/server.py)
- Replace `<WEBHOOK_URI>` placeholders with actual webhook URIs from your SentinelOne environment
