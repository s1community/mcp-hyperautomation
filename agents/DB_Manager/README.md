# DB Agent

## Agent Purpose

This Agent acts as a data bridge to move results generated by HA Agents outside of the HyperAutomation platform. Due to lack of bidirectional data flow support, Agent results must be temporarily stored in an internet-accessible database so that the MCP server can retrieve the workflow responses.

Users can choose any cloud database compatible with HyperAutomation's supported authentication methods (`basic`, `API Key`, `OAuth2.0`). This prototype uses [Google Big Query](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery) as the temporary storage solution for agents results.

## Implemented Functionalities

- This Agent operates transparently and does not expose any direct capabilities to end users.
