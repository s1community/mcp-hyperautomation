# DB Agent

## Agent Purpose

This DB behaves as a bridge  by moving data generated by the HA Agents outside of the HyperAutomation layer. Agent results need to be temporarily stored in an internet-facing DB so that the MCP server can retrieve the tools' responses. 

Users can choose any cloud DBs as long as they're compatible with the authentication methods supported by HyperAutomation (`basic`, `API Key`, `OAuth2.0`)
This prototype uses [Google Big Query](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery) as a cloud DB to temporarily store results. 

## Implemented Functionalities

- The Agent does not expose any capabilities to the end user.
